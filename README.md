# Chameleon Programming Language

A programming language for me to learn how to implement various programming language
backends.

## Todos

* function signature table for inferring argument types (for null for example)
* improve code dealing with implicit casting (numbers and nulls)
* garbage collector
* arrays
* strings (maybe implemented in the language)
* default field values for structs
* allow defining referenced functions later
* allow main to return void
* change type casting scheme to allow opt to optimize away casting instructions if possible (maybe type hints)
* separate type checker from generator
* make type checker give good error messages and protect against errors in the
generator stage
* nested inlined structs
* implement implicit type casting for ints to floats but not longs to floats
* implement implicit type casting for function inputs (function signatures)
* web assembly backend?
* experiment with optimization
* type checker that gives good error messages
* closure
* operator precedence

* linked lists (user land?) (done)
* pointers?? how to do linked lists wo pointers? (done)
* integrate malloc and free for dynamic memory (done)
* structs (done)
* while loops (done)
* allow main to not have to return 0 explicitly (done)
* comparison operators (done)
* if statements (done)
* function definitions (done)
* cast from integer to floats correctly (done)
* arithemetic for floats (done)
* fix implicit type casts (done)
* explicit casting functions (done)
* numeric types (done)
* lexer/parser (done)

## Features

* numbers
* linked-lists
* strings as linked-list of characters
* functions
* dictionary as binary tree
