# Chameleon Programming Language

A programming language for me to learn how to implement various programming language
backends.

## Todos

* allow main to not have to return 0 explicitly
* if statements
* while loops
* structs
* arrays
* allow defining referenced functions later
* change type casting scheme to allow opt to optimize away casting instructions if possible (maybe type hints)
* separate type checker from generator
* implement implicit type casting for ints to floats but not longs to floats
* implement implicit type casting for function inputs (function signatures)
* web assembly backend?
* experiment with optimization
* type checker that gives good error messages
* closure
* linked lists (user land?)
* strings (maybe implemented in the language)
* operator precedence

* function definitions (done)
* cast from integer to floats correctly (done)
* arithemetic for floats (done)
* fix implicit type casts (done)
* explicit casting functions (done)
* numeric types (done)
* lexer/parser (done)

## Features

* numbers
* linked-lists
* strings as linked-list of characters
* functions
* dictionary as binary tree
